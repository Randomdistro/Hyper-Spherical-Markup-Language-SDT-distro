- **Deployment Coordination**: Prepare and execute deployment processes
- **Cross-Component Testing**: Validate end-to-end functionality
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintain user-facing documentation

### **Authority Level: MEDIUM**
- Integration approach and timing
- Deployment sequence decisions
- Documentation structure
- User-facing feature descriptions

### **Session Responsibilities**
- Merge approved changes into main codebase
- Run comprehensive integration tests
- Update user documentation
- Prepare deployment packages

### **Communication Protocol**
- **File**: `agent_workspace/integration_comms.md`
- **Update Frequency**: During integration cycles
- **Escalation**: To Reviewer for integration issues, to Architect for structural problems
- **Handoff**: Back to Implementer for bug fixes if needed

---

## üö¶ **Decision-Making Hierarchy**

### **Level 1: Architectural Decisions**
- **Decision Maker**: Architect Agent
- **Examples**: System design, major refactoring approaches, rule interpretations
- **Process**: Architect reviews, decides, documents in `architect_comms.md`

### **Level 2: Implementation Decisions**
- **Decision Maker**: Implementer Agent (with Reviewer approval)
- **Examples**: Function organization, error handling approach, local optimizations
- **Process**: Implementer proposes, Reviewer validates, both document

### **Level 3: Integration Decisions**
- **Decision Maker**: Integration Agent (with Reviewer oversight)
- **Examples**: Merge timing, deployment sequence, documentation updates
- **Process**: Integration Agent plans, Reviewer approves, Integration Agent executes

---

## üîÑ **Conflict Resolution Protocol**

### **Implementation vs. Architecture Conflict**
1. Implementer documents concern in `implementer_comms.md`
2. Architect reviews and makes final decision
3. Decision documented in `architect_comms.md`
4. All agents updated via `comms.md`

### **Quality vs. Timeline Conflict**
1. Reviewer documents quality concerns
2. Architect weighs quality vs. timeline impact
3. Decision made with clear rationale
4. Adjusted plan communicated to all agents

### **Integration vs. Feature Conflict**
1. Integration Agent documents integration issues
2. Reviewer validates technical concerns
3. Architect makes final priority decision
4. Updated plan cascaded to all agents
