# CAD Design Agent - Hierarchical Oversight Protocol

## 🎯 **Oversight Philosophy**

The oversight system ensures that all development work aligns with project goals, follows established rules, and maintains high quality standards. Each level of oversight has specific responsibilities and authority to maintain project integrity.

## 🏛️ **Three-Tier Oversight Structure**

### **Tier 1: Strategic Oversight (Architect Agent)**
- **Focus**: Architecture, rules, and long-term vision
- **Frequency**: Every major decision or structural change
- **Authority**: Final decision-making power on all architectural matters

### **Tier 2: Quality Oversight (Reviewer Agent)**
- **Focus**: Code quality, rule compliance, and integration
- **Frequency**: Every implementation cycle
- **Authority**: Approve/reject implementations, enforce standards

### **Tier 3: Operational Oversight (Integration Agent)**
- **Focus**: Deployment readiness and user experience
- **Frequency**: Every integration cycle
- **Authority**: Deployment decisions and user-facing changes

## 📋 **Oversight Checkpoints**

### **Pre-Implementation Checkpoint**
**Trigger**: Before starting any significant development work
**Participants**: Architect + Implementer
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes of planning

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Task aligns with project goals
- [ ] Approach follows established architecture
- [ ] No rule violations anticipated
- [ ] Dependencies identified and available
- [ ] Success criteria clearly defined

**Outputs**:
- Approved implementation plan
- Updated `architect_comms.md`
- Clear go/no-go decision

### **Post-Implementation Checkpoint**
**Trigger**: After completing implementation work
**Participants**: Reviewer + Implementer
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes of review

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Code meets quality standards
- [ ] All rules followed correctly
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced

**Outputs**:
- Approved/rejected implementation
- Quality assessment report
- Integration readiness status

### **Pre-Integration Checkpoint**
**Trigger**: Before merging changes into main codebase
**Participants**: Integration Agent + Reviewer
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes of validation

**Checklist**:
- [ ] All components integrate correctly
- [ ] End-to-end functionality verified
- [ ] User experience impact assessed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployment readiness confirmed

**Outputs**:
- Integration approval
- Deployment plan
- User impact assessment

## 🚨 **Quality Gates**

### **Gate 1: Architectural Compliance**
**Owner**: Architect Agent
**Criteria**:
- Follows established system architecture
- Adheres to all development rules
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Supports future extensibility

**Failure Actions**:
- Implementation blocked until compliance achieved
- Architectural guidance provided
- Alternative approach suggested

### **Gate 2: Code Quality**
**Owner**: Reviewer Agent
**Criteria**:
- Code is clean and well-documented
- Error handling is appropriate
- Performance is acceptable
- Tests are comprehensive (when applicable)

**Failure Actions**:
- Code returned for revision
- Specific quality issues documented
- Improvement guidance provided

### **Gate 3: Integration Readiness**
**Owner**: Integration Agent
**Criteria**:
- Components integrate seamlessly
- User experience is maintained/improved
- Documentation is complete
- Deployment is safe

**Failure Actions**:
- Integration delayed until issues resolved
- Integration plan revised
- Additional testing required

## 🔍 **Review Protocols**

### **Code Review Protocol**
1. **Automated Checks**: Run compliance checker and automated tests
2. **Manual Review**: Check code quality, patterns, and documentation
3. **Integration Test**: Verify component interactions
4. **Documentation Review**: Ensure user-facing docs are updated
5. **Sign-off**: Formal approval or rejection with rationale

### **Architectural Review Protocol**
1. **Design Assessment**: Evaluate approach against system architecture
2. **Rule Compliance**: Verify adherence to all development rules
3. **Impact Analysis**: Assess impact on other components
4. **Future Compatibility**: Ensure approach supports future needs
5. **Decision**: Approve, modify, or reject with clear reasoning

### **Integration Review Protocol**
1. **Functionality Test**: Verify end-to-end feature operation
2. **Performance Check**: Ensure acceptable performance impact
3. **User Experience**: Validate user-facing improvements
4. **Deployment Safety**: Confirm safe deployment process
5. **Release Decision**: Approve for deployment or require fixes

## 🚦 **Escalation Procedures**

### **Technical Escalation**
**Trigger**: Complex technical decisions or conflicts
**Path**: Implementer → Reviewer → Architect
**Timeline**: Immediate for blockers, within one session for others
**Resolution**: Architect makes final technical decision

### **Quality Escalation**
**Trigger**: Repeated quality failures or standard disputes
**Path**: Reviewer → Architect
**Timeline**: After second quality failure
**Resolution**: Architect clarifies standards or provides additional guidance

### **Timeline Escalation**
**Trigger**: Delays impacting project milestones
**Path**: Any Agent → Architect
**Timeline**: When delays exceed one session
**Resolution**: Architect adjusts priorities or approach
