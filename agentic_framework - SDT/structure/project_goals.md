## 📝 **Customization Instructions**

1. **Replace [PROJECT NAME]** with your actual project name
2. **Fill in all bracketed placeholders** with your specific details
3. **Adjust success metrics** to match your project type
4. **Update technology stack** to reflect your chosen tools
5. **Modify timeline** based on your project scope and resources
6. **Add domain-specific requirements** as needed

## 🎯 **Framework Integration**

This project goals file integrates with the agentic development framework:

- **Architect Agent** uses this for architectural decisions
- **Implementer Agents** reference this for feature prioritization
- **Reviewer Agent** validates implementations against these goals
- **Integration Agent** ensures deployments meet success criteria
