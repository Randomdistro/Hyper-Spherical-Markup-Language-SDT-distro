# 🚀 Agentic Framework Setup Guide

*Complete guide to setting up your first agentic development project*

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

### **Required Tools**
- Multiple Claude instances (Claude Pro or Claude Max recommended)
- Text editor or IDE for managing markdown files
- Version control system (Git recommended)
- Project management tool (optional but helpful)

### **Recommended Setup**
- **Claude Max** for Architect and Reviewer roles (higher reasoning capability)
- **Claude Pro** for Implementer and Integration roles (cost-effective for execution)
- **Minimum 2 Claude instances** (can combine roles if needed)
- **Optimal 4 Claude instances** (one per role for maximum efficiency)

## 🏗️ **Step-by-Step Setup**

### **Step 1: Project Initialization**

1. **Copy the Framework**
   ```bash
   # Copy the entire agentic_framework folder to your project location
   cp -r agentic_framework my_new_project
   cd my_new_project
   ```

2. **Customize Project Identity**
   - Rename the folder to match your project
   - Update `README.md` with your project name
   - Initialize git repository if using version control

3. **Set Up Basic Structure**
   ```
   my_new_project/
   ├── src/                    # Your source code (create as needed)
   ├── tests/                  # Your test files (create as needed)
   ├── docs/                   # Project documentation
   ├── rules/                  # Development rules (from framework)
   ├── structure/              # Project organization (from framework)
   ├── agent_workspace/        # Agent communication (from framework)
   ├── templates/              # Reusable templates (from framework)
   ├── TODO.md                 # Project task list (create from template)
   └── README.md               # Project overview (customize)
   ```

### **Step 2: Project Configuration**

1. **Configure Project Goals**
   ```bash
   # Copy and customize the project goals template
   cp templates/project_goals_template.md structure/project_goals.md
   ```
   
   **Edit `structure/project_goals.md`:**
   - Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your actual project name
   - Fill in your vision and core goals
   - Set your success metrics and timeline
   - Define your technology stack
   - Specify quality standards

2. **Set Up TODO Management**
   ```bash
   # Copy and customize the TODO template
   cp templates/TODO_template.md TODO.md
   ```
   
   **Edit `TODO.md`:**
   - Replace `[PROJECT NAME]` with your project name
   - Add your initial high-priority tasks
   - Set up your first sprint goals

3. **Initialize Communication Hub**
   
   **Edit `structure/comms.md`:**
   - Update the current sprint focus
   - Set initial agent assignments
   - Define immediate objectives

### **Step 3: Agent Role Assignment**

1. **Identify Your Claude Instances**
   - Label each Claude instance with its role
   - Document which instance handles which responsibilities
   - Set up bookmarks or tabs for easy access

2. **Configure Agent Workspaces**
   
   **For each agent, edit their communication file:**
   
   **Architect Agent** (`agent_workspace/architect_comms.md`):
   - Set current architectural priorities
   - Define decision-making authority
   - List pending architectural decisions
   
   **Implementer Agent** (`agent_workspace/implementer_comms.md`):
   - Assign initial implementation tasks
   - Set up development approach
   - Define quality constraints
   
   **Reviewer Agent** (`agent_workspace/reviewer_comms.md`):
   - Configure review standards
   - Set up quality gates
   - Define approval criteria
   
   **Integration Agent** (`agent_workspace/integration_comms.md`):
   - Set up integration pipeline
   - Define deployment standards
   - Configure monitoring approach

### **Step 4: Development Rules Customization**

1. **Review Existing Rules**
   - Read through all files in `rules/`
   - Understand the quality standards
   - Identify any conflicts with your tech stack

2. **Customize Rules for Your Project**
   
   **Technology-Specific Rules:**
   - Update code examples to match your language
   - Adjust line limits if needed for your context
   - Add framework-specific patterns
   
   **Project-Specific Rules:**
   - Add domain-specific quality requirements
   - Include security standards for your industry
   - Define performance benchmarks

3. **Add Custom Rules**
   ```bash
   # Create custom rules as needed
   touch rules/custom_security_standards.md
   touch rules/domain_specific_patterns.md
   ```

## 🎮 **First Development Session**

### **Session Preparation**

1. **Open Multiple Claude Instances**
   - Label each tab/window with agent role
   - Have all communication files accessible
   - Prepare your development environment

2. **Initial Agent Sync**
   - Each agent reads `structure/comms.md`
   - Each agent reviews their role-specific file
   - All agents understand current objectives

### **Architect Agent - First Session**

**Objective**: Establish architectural foundation

**Tasks:**
1. Review `structure/project_goals.md`
2. Make initial architectural decisions

4. Define module structure
5. Update `agent_workspace/architect_comms.md`

**Template Usage:**
```bash
# Copy session template for tracking
cp templates/agent_session_template.md sessions/session_1_architect.md
```

### **Implementer Agent - First Session**

**Objective**: Set up initial project structure

**Tasks:**
1. Create basic project scaffolding
2. Set up development environment

### **Reviewer Agent - First Session**

**Objective**: Establish quality standards

**Tasks:**
1. Review initial implementations
2. Set up quality checking procedures
3. Validate rule compliance
4. Provide feedback to implementer
5. Update `agent_workspace/reviewer_comms.md`

### **Integration Agent - First Session**

**Check these indicators:**
- [ ] All agents have clear, assigned tasks
- [ ] Communication files are actively maintained
- [ ] Code quality meets established standards
- [ ] Integration pipeline is functional
- [ ] Progress is visible and measurable

**Quality Metrics:**
- Rule compliance rate: Should be >90%
- Agent coordination: No conflicts or blockers
- Development velocity: Consistent progress
- Code quality: Meets established standards

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**Issue: Agents working on conflicting tasks**
- Solution: Improve communication in `structure/comms.md`
- Prevention: More detailed task assignment

**Issue: Quality standards not being met**
- Solution: Stricter reviewer oversight
- Prevention: Better rule documentation

**Issue: Integration problems**
- Solution: More frequent integration cycles
- Prevention: Better architectural planning

## 🔄 **Ongoing Maintenance**

### **Daily Operations**
- Update TODO.md at start/end of sessions
- Maintain agent communication files
- Track progress against project goals
- Address blockers promptly

### **Weekly Reviews**
- Review development velocity
- Assess quality metrics
- Update project goals if needed
- Improve processes based on learnings
