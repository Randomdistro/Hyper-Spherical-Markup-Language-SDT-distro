# Error Limiting and Test Signaling

## Ten Key Points About This Rule

1. Establishes a framework for robust error handling throughout an application
2. Requires try/catch blocks around potential failure points for increased stability
3. Implements graceful degradation patterns when operations fail
4. Creates a standardized test signaling system for debugging and quality assurance
5. Provides detailed examples of error handling for database operations
6. Shows comprehensive API call error handling with timeout and response validation
7. Includes patterns for handling file operation errors and system limitations
8. Maintains a central repository of test signals for better organization
9. Uses consistent error and signal patterns for improved system monitoring
10. Creates an audit trail for testing that helps identify and resolve issues

**Rule**: Insert error limiting and test signaling code for every operation that may not perform as intended.

**Guidelines**:
- Add proper error handling for all risky operations
- Include try/catch blocks (or language equivalent) around potential failure points
- Implement graceful degradation when operations fail
- Add logging or test signals for debugging and quality assurance
- Maintain a central list of all test signals in a "test_signal_outputs" file
- Use consistent error and signal patterns throughout the project
- Include specific error messages that aid in troubleshooting

**Benefits**:
- Prevents application crashes and unexpected behavior
- Makes debugging easier and more efficient
- Provides clear feedback on operation status
- Increases system robustness and reliability
- Creates an audit trail for testing and quality assurance
