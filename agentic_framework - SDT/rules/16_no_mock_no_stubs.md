# No Mock No Stubs No Placeholders

## Ten Key Points About This Rule

1. Eliminates all mock implementations, stubs, and placeholder code from production systems
2. Requires real, functional implementations for all methods and classes
3. Replaces temporary "TODO" implementations with actual working code
4. Ensures all API endpoints return real data instead of mock responses
5. Implements actual database operations instead of simulated ones
6. Provides real error handling instead of placeholder error messages
7. Creates genuine integrations with external systems rather than mocked interfaces
8. Implements actual file operations instead of fake file handling
9. Ensures all user interfaces connect to real backend functionality
10. Makes the entire system production-ready with no fake components

**Rule**: Replace all mock implementations, stubs, placeholders, and TODO code with real, functional implementations.

**Guidelines**:
- Search for and eliminate all mock, stub, and placeholder code
- Replace "TODO" comments with actual implementations
- Implement real functionality for all methods marked as temporary
- Create actual database connections and operations
- Implement real API integrations instead of mock responses
- Provide genuine error handling with specific exceptions
- Replace simulation code with actual system interactions
- Ensure all user-facing features work with real backend data
- Remove development-only placeholder messages and responses
- Test all implementations to ensure they work in production scenarios

**Benefits**:
- Creates a production-ready system with no fake components
- Eliminates confusion between development and production code
- Ensures reliable functionality in real-world scenarios
- Builds user confidence through genuine system behavior
- Reduces technical debt from temporary implementations
- Provides accurate testing and validation results

## Examples

### 1. API Endpoint Implementation
```python
# Poor Practice - Mock Response
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users():
    # TODO: Replace with real database query
    return {"users": ["mock_user_1", "mock_user_2"]}

# Good Practice - Real Implementation
@app.get("/users")
async def get_users():
    try:
        users = await database.fetch_all("SELECT * FROM users")
        return {"users": [dict(user) for user in users]}
    except DatabaseError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Database error: {str(e)}")
```

### 2. File Operations
```python
# Poor Practice - Placeholder Implementation
def save_file(filename: str, content: str) -> bool:
    # TODO: Implement actual file saving
    print(f"Would save {filename}")
    return True

# Good Practice - Real Implementation
def save_file(filename: str, content: str) -> bool:
    try:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        logger.info(f"Successfully saved file: {filename}")
        return True
    except IOError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to save file {filename}: {str(e)}")
        return False
```

### 3. External Service Integration
```python
# Poor Practice - Mock Service
class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> bool:
        # Mock implementation for development
        print(f"Mock: Sending email to {to}")
        return True

# Good Practice - Real Implementation
class EmailService:
    def __init__(self, smtp_host: str, smtp_port: int, username: str, password: str):
        self.smtp_host = smtp_host
        self.smtp_port = smtp_port
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
    
    def send_email(self, to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> bool:
        try:
            with smtplib.SMTP(self.smtp_host, self.smtp_port) as server:
                server.starttls()
                server.login(self.username, self.password)
                
                msg = MIMEMultipart()
                msg['From'] = self.username
                msg['To'] = to
                msg['Subject'] = subject
                msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
                
                server.send_message(msg)
                return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to send email: {str(e)}")
            return False
```
