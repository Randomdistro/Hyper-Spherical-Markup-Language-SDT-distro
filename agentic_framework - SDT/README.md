# 🤖 Agentic Development Framework

*A Complete Self-Actualizing AI Development System*

## 🎯 **What is This?**

This is a **complete, standalone framework** for implementing structured AI development teams using multiple Claude instances (or other AI agents). It provides hierarchical oversight, quality control, and systematic development processes that can be applied to any software project.

## 🏗️ **Framework Architecture**

### **🏛️ Hierarchical Agent Structure**
- **🏗️ Architect Agent** (Claude Max) - Strategic oversight and architectural decisions
- **🔍 Reviewer Agent** (Claude Max) - Quality assurance and rule compliance  
- **⚙️ Implementer Agents** (Claude Pro/Max) - Feature development and refactoring
- **🔗 Integration Agent** (Claude Pro) - Deployment coordination and testing

### **📋 Core Components**
- **Development Rules** - Comprehensive coding standards and practices
- **Communication Protocol** - Structured agent coordination system
- **Quality Gates** - Multi-tier oversight and review processes
- **Template System** - Reusable patterns and structures

## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Project**
1. Copy this entire `agentic_framework` folder to your new project directory
2. Rename it to match your project (e.g., `my_awesome_project`)
3. Initialize your project structure using the templates

### **Step 2: Configure for Your Project**
1. Edit `structure/project_goals.md` with your specific objectives
2. Update `structure/comms.md` with your current sprint focus
3. Customize the rules in `rules/` for your technology stack
4. Set up your agent workspace assignments

### **Step 3: Start Development**
1. Open multiple Claude windows/tabs
2. Assign each Claude instance a specific agent role
3. Each agent reads their role-specific communication file
4. Follow the structured handoff protocols

## 🎮 **How to Use This Framework**

### **For Each Development Session:**

1. **🏗️ Architect Agent**: 
   - Read `structure/comms.md` for current status
   - Review `agent_workspace/architect_comms.md` for pending decisions
   - Make architectural decisions and update guidance
   - Approve implementation approaches

2. **⚙️ Implementer Agent**:
   - Check `agent_workspace/implementer_comms.md` for assigned tasks
   - Follow the implementation plan and architectural guidance
   - Update progress and document any blockers
   - Submit work for reviewer approval

3. **🔍 Reviewer Agent**:
   - Review submitted implementations using quality checklists
   - Run compliance checks against development rules
   - Approve or request changes with specific feedback
   - Coordinate with integration agent for approved work

4. **🔗 Integration Agent**:
   - Integrate approved components following safety protocols
   - Run end-to-end testing and validation
   - Deploy changes and monitor system health
   - Update documentation and user communications

## 🎯 **Key Benefits**
